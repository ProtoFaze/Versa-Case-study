## Step 1: Install nodeJS
Go to (https://nodejs.org/) and download the nodeJS installer based on your system.  
This should also include npm.  
To check if both are installed, open your terminal and run.
```shell
node -v
npm -v
```
This displays the downloaded version for nodeJS and npm.

## Step 2: Install typescript
Next, install typescript via your terminal by running.
```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

## Step 3: Install ts-node
Install ts-node to run typescript files directly.
```shell
npm install -g ts-node
```

## Step 4: Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Step 5: Run the project in the repository
In your terminal, remember to change directory [cd] to where you downloaded the repository and run.
```shell
ts-node bigbang.ts
```
